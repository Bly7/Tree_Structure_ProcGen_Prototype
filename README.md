# Tree_Structure_ProcGen_Prototype

This was a quick and dirty tree structure generation prototype. It is very untested, very buggy, and very uncommented. It was made in SFML 2.5 so you will need to set that up to get it running, but once sfml is set up it is good to go. Have fun tweaking it, breaking it, and/or adding onto it. It was just a fun thing to make and if anyone wants to play with it you can.
